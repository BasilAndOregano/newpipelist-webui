# WebUI for newpipelist

Simplifies the process of running newpipelist in a browser using PyScript



# Goals

Allow users to extract NewPipe playlists from newpipe.db entirely from the browser
Upload option so it can be used entirely within GitHub pages
Ability to automatically fetch a playlist link for use with Piped (Likely by feeding the queue to an Invidious instance and then fetching the resulting temporary playlist URL)
