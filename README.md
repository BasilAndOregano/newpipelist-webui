# WebUI for newpipelist

Simplifies the process of running newpipelist in a browser using PyScript



# Current Goals

In order of significance (most to least)
1. Allow users to extract NewPipe playlists from newpipe.db entirely from the browser
2. Upload option so it can be used entirely within GitHub pages
3. Ability to automatically fetch a playlist link for use with Piped (Likely by feeding the queue to an Invidious instance and then fetching the resulting temporary playlist URL)
